Mittens snuck out yesterday night and came back limping :(

Hopefully going to go to the vet tomorrow with grandparents to see if we can find out what's wrong. I tried to shave the leg that was paining him but he was kicking up a storm so that's a no-go. Maybe now he'll learn that sneaking out is NOT fun. Although, I wouldn't blame him either. If I were a cat, I'd rather chase chipmunks than stay inside all day...
