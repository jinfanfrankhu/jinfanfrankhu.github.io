title: "3 Hours of Sleep: The Humble Text Message Conversation"

Disclaimer: I am operating on 3 hours of sleep. Forgive me if the writing quality is dookie buns.

Last night, I practically pulled an all nighter. I slept at 7am after a lovely conversation with a friend on text. From an absolute standpoint, there is absolutely more distance when it comes to texting rather than calling. I mean, all you're doing is reading words off a page, there's no voice, no intonation, no prosody.

Despite this, I love text conversations far more than calls. When I call, I find myself getting distracted and I concentrate on other work. Sometimes my phone calls fall into this weird silence that feels difficult to recover. It's supposed to be a virtual conversation yet I don't know how to interact the same way I'm able to do so in person. On the other hand, texting is a game of trust. Unlike calls, anything that you type is final once you hit the "send" button. There's both this pressure to type the exact right thing, and also this freedom to type and delete, type and delete over and over again until the person on the other side of the conversation thinks you've just left them on read/seen.

And that last part is why I love text conversations so much: when there's a back and forth that goes on for ages, and there are moments where you hesitate and retype again and again, I could easily just swipe away from the conversation, go scroll tiktok or watch insta reels, and that's that. The conversation is over. So when the conversations go on forever, and even when you see those bubbles of "..." appearing and disappearing over and over again, I always feel the slightest bit happier when after a long while, another text bubble appears, picking up the conversation. There was no pressure to continue. But I smile when they do.

We are goated twin.
