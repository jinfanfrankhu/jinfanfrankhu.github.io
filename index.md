    <h1>Hi. My name is Jinfan Frank Hu. Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>Iâ€™m a senior at Phillips Academy Andover exploring language and AI.</p>
    <p>Check out my <a href="/about">about me</a>, <a href="/projects">projects</a>, or some of my <a href="/posts">posts</a>.</p>

I won't lie to you and tell you that I've got it all figured out, but I love making stuff, fixing problems, and understanding things. I also love my cats. Even if they're a little naughty. Or if they scratch me. (The black one is Mittens and the white one is Coco!)

I've broken two bones (thanks hockey), I speak English, Mandarin, Spanish, and French decent enough (will still get yelled at by a Parisian though).
